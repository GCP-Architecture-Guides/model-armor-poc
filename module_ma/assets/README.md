# Assets for the Model Armor Proof of Concept demo.

The majority of the assets in this directory are for the demo that is built out by the terraform and scripts from the [base repository](https://github.com/GCP-Architecture-Guides/model-armor-poc).  

The exception is the [Demo_Model_Armor_GCP_2025.ipynb](GCP-Architecture-Guides/model-armor-poc/blob/main/module_ma/assets/Demo_Model_Armor_GCP_2025.ipynb) notebook.  This is a stand-alone notebook that can be run in your own co-lab environment in your project that you may already have running.  If you do not have a project already setup, follow the base project.  If
you have a co-lab environment running in a project, you can use this notebook to run a basic proof of concept exercise in that environment.
